    "1. Load in the data in `companies.csv` and `prices.csv` (in the data folder).\n",
    "2. Write a function `is_incorporated` that checks whether an input string, `name`, contains the substring \"inc\" or \"Inc\". Its definition should look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def is_incorporated(name):\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Yes, all these companies are incorporated, but bear with us for the exercise.)\n",
    "3. Test this function to be sure it works. Try passing in some strings that contain the substring and some that don't. Test it on data from the companies DataFrame.\n",
    "4. Write a `for` loop to iterate through the elements in the Name column of the companies data, applying `is_incorporated` to each element and printing the result.\n",
    "5. Now rewrite the code for #4 using the `Series.apply` method -- apply the function to the Series and print the resulting Series.\n",
    "6. *Similar, but less guided.* Create a new column, name_length, whose value is:\n",
    "    - `\"long\"` if the company name is over 12 characters\n",
    "    - `\"medium\"` if the company name is 8-11 characters\n",
    "    - `\"short\"` if the company name is 7 or fewer characters.\n",
    "7. Write a function `make_colname_string` that takes a DataFrame as an argument and returns a string that contains all the DataFrame's columns' names, comma separated. For example, running `make_colname_string` on our companies data would look like this:<br><br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "make_colname_string(companies)\n",
    "#> 'Symbol,Name,Sector'\n",

    "<br>*Hint: a for loop will be helpful.* Test it on the prices data. What does it return?\n",

    "### Putting It All Together\n",
    "Suppose you've discovered a great secret about the stock market: companies with long names (as defined above) are going to double in value after quarter 4 (our most recent data), companies with short names are going to halve in value, and medium-name companies will stay exactly the same. Create a dataset of the form:\n",
    "| Name | Symbol | Projected |\n",
    "-------|--------|------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \"Projected\" is the projected price of the company's stock (2x, 1x, .5x as explained above). Note that you will need to join companies to prices and do some data wrangling operations."
